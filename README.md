# LYRICLE is still under development and is due for realease by the end of May 2022

## Lyricle - Project 4 @ GA (General Assembly) 

This was my final solo project on GA's Software Engineering Immersive course. 

## Deployment 

This app has been deployed via Heroku and Netlify and is available [here](https://playlyricle.com/)

# Objective

- To build a full-stack application by making your own back-end and your own front-end.
- Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database.
- Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React.
- Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models.
- Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut.
- Be deployed online so itâ€™s publicly accessible.

# Languages Used

- Python
- Javascript
- SCSS
- HTML5

## Concept

This App was concieved as a spin off of the viral guessing game Wordle (guess the 5 letter word and get clues from correct letters guessed). In Lyricle however, the user is instead given the clues. These take shape as 5 seperate sections of a song that hint towards the songs title with the aim being to guess the song in as few guesses as possible. Users can also sign up and join leagues with their friends, to compete over specific artists. 

## Phase One (Days 1-2) 

**Concept, Whiteboarding & Pseudocoding **
